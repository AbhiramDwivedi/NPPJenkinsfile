# Notepad ++ Jenkinsfile Language

# Introduction

This repository is a home for Notepad++ language for Jenkins Pipeline As Code [Jenkins Pipeline As Code](https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/) and supports [Declarative Pipeline] (https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline).

Download the Jenkinsfile.xml and import it to Notepad++ to start using.

Given that Jenkinsfile will often have no extension, for a given Jenkinsfile, you may have to manually apply this language to an opened Jenkinsfile in NPP.
